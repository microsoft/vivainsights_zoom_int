# Viva Insights Zoom Data Integration

The Zoom Collaboration analysis provides analysts with an opportunity to derive meaningful additional collaboration metrics from Zoom meeting reports that complement existing metrics provided by Workplace Analytics. 

Analysts can use this to understand collaboration that occurs on Zoom with a primary focus on unscheduled collaboration. Analysts can download the output either as a standalone .csv file with collaboration metrics for unscheduled Zoom calls or as a Ways of working assessment input file (with Zoom collaboration metrics) and the modified Ways of working assessment Power BI template.

This analysis will help leaders & analysts get a richer and more complete picture of the collaboration patterns of their organization.
